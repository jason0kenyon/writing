This is a collection of solutions to textbooks and my personal writing on a variety of topics.
My personal writing is precisely that, personal; if you disagree with something I have written, feel free to raise an issue. I will gladly discuss my views with you, and search for truth together. If you convince me that I am wrong, fantastic; I welcome this. I am often wrong, although I wish that were not the case.
